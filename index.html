         <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.</p>
         <p>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, 
           grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.</p>

         <p>Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire carefully and study how it interacts with the park's ecosystems. This blog provides updates about fires in 
           Yosemite. Check for<span style="font-weight:bold;"> current fire restrictions.</span> </p>
